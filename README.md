## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m an AI researcher leveraging Keras and TensorFlow to explore and implement novel deep learning architectures. This repository features a collection of research-driven projects focused on custom model design, experimental training workflows, and pushing the boundaries of what deep neural networks can do.

My work centers around building and analyzing advanced models for tasks such as image classification, sequence modeling, and representation learning. By combining the flexibility of TensorFlow with the intuitive API of Keras, I develop highly configurable models that support reproducible experimentation and in-depth evaluation.

Custom Model Designs: These projects go beyond off-the-shelf layers to explore new architectural ideas, including custom loss functions, attention mechanisms, residual connections, and hybrid models. You'll find fully implemented class-based models using TensorFlowâ€™s low-level APIs for greater control over training and inference.

Research-Based Projects: Inspired by recent papers and original research questions, each project is organized around experimentation and innovation. I include comparisons with baseline models, detailed training logs, and ablation studies to assess each architectural choice.

Experimentation & Reproducibility: Experimentation is key to research. This repository features configuration-driven training scripts, logging with TensorBoard, and saved model checkpoints to support reproducible results and iterative development.

This repository is intended for fellow researchers, ML engineers, and students who are interested in the cutting edge of deep learning. Each folder includes structured code, relevant datasets or links, and documentation to guide exploration and further experimentation.

Feel free to fork, contribute, or reach out with feedbackâ€”collaboration and open sharing are central to advancing AI research.
